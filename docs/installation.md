# Installation

qst cli can run on all major operating systems as long as you have go installed and can clone this repository.

**Install locally using `go build`**:

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Carter907/quest-cli.git
cd quest-cli
```

Build and install to your `GOPATH/bin`:

- **macOS / Linux**:
  ```sh
  go build -o $(go env GOPATH)/bin/qst .
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell)**:
  ```powershell
  go build -o "$((go env GOPATH))\bin\qst.exe" .
  ```

- **Windows (Command Prompt)**:
  ```cmd
  go build -o "%USERPROFILE%\go\bin\qst.exe" .
  ```

*(Optional)* If you prefer to build the executable directly in the current directory:
- **macOS / Linux**: `go build -o qst .`
- **Windows**: `go build -o qst.exe .`

Make sure your Go bin directory (e.g., `$GOPATH/bin` or `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`) is included in your system's `PATH`.
